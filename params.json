Feel you free to use it as a demo application while learing/investigating famo.us. \r\n\r\nWill be very appreciated to get feedback, bugreports or suggestions how to improve the code.  \r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\nFirst make sure you have node.js, grunt-cli, and bower installed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install node\r\nnpm install -g grunt-cli bower\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are installing node for the fist time you will most likely need to add npm to your path\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ export PATH=\"/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will probably want to add that to you .bash_profile.  I'll assume if you are using any other shell that you know what you are doing already :P\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install && bower install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it!!!\r\n\r\n##Running the Development Server\r\n\r\nSimply run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open Chrome.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.\r\n\r\nYou can run serve with ```--port=9001``` to manually pick the port that the server will run on\r\n\r\n##Production\r\n\r\nIf you would like to compile your project for distribution simply run the command ```grunt``` to build ```dist/``` which will be a deployment ready version of your app.  Preprocessing will be applied to html, all js will be concatenated and minified.  All js / css assets will also have their name prepended with a hash for cache busting.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
